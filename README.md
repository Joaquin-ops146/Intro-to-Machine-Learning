# Real Estate Price Prediction Model
This project is part of the "Intro to Machine Learning" course from Kaggle, where I developed a model to predict real estate prices. 
The scenario of the course is that I work with my cousin in the real estate sector, this project has practical applications in estimating property values.
## Data Processing and Feature Engineering ##
* **Data Exploration:** Used pandas to manipulate datasets and analyze key variables influencing property prices.

## Model Training and Optimization ##
* **Algorithm Selection:** Implemented Decision Trees and advanced models like Random Forest to enhance predictive accuracy.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Used GridSearchCV to optimize parameters and boost model efficiency.
* **Cross-Validation:** Applied K-Fold cross-validation to ensure model robustness and stability.
## Results and Insights ##
* The model successfully predicts house prices with high accuracy.
* Feature engineering played a key role in improving performance.
* Hyperparameter tuning helped refine predictions, making the model more reliable for real-world applications.
